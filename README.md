# CS-340FinalProject
Final project journal for CS-340
## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I keep my code as decoupled and modular as possible.  I try to keep modules small with file and structure names that explicitly describe the purpose of the module and structure.  The advantage to writing code this way ensures code that can easily change to updated dependencies and feature enhancement.

I could use this CRUD Python module for other similar database controllers with little to no code alteration.


## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach to a problem involves breaking the problem into much smaller problems.  The only difference from this course's assignments to other assignments in different courses was the syntax and problem being solved.  However, the approach was quite similar, as it likely would be with most problems being solved with software.  

Dissect a problem into smaller problems.  Write pseudocode.  Then, write the actual code and tests 10 or so lines at a time before testing systematic and incremental steps towards solving the initial holistic problem.


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve modern world problems with the software they write.  A real world project like this would help a company maintain and quickly analyze their data, so that they could do their jobs more efficiently.
